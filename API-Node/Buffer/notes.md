Binary Data
----
> ### Definition - What does Binary Data mean?

> Binary data is a type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system. Binary data is the only category of data that can be directly understood and executed by a computer. It is numerically represented by a combination of zeros and ones.

> ## Techopedia explains Binary Data

> Binary data is considered the native data/language of a computer and it interacts with the lowest abstraction layer of its hardware. This type of data is produced whenever a process is performed on a computer. The application requesting the process sends instructions in a high-level language that is ultimately converted into binary data to be executed or sent to the processor. All processes, regardless of their type, are converted into binary form before execution. 
Most binary data can only be read by a computer, not a human.
